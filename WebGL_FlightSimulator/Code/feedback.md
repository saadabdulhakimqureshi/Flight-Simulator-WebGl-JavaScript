The distribution of the % score in the homework is as follows.

- (min, max) : (40, 101.7)
- (mean, median, st. dev.) : (87.7, 90.4, 16.0)

Learned
-

The students reported learning the following by doing the homework.

- Generate terrain
- Moving camera according to player input so that it gives the illusion of flight.
- Applying different transformations to camera
- Collaborating with others
- Applying lighting and shading to scenes
- Shading with respect to phong color scheme, smooth color scheme or flat color scheme
- rotating the camera according any x,y,z axis
- coloring surface using height as a parameter
- Apply viewing transformations to a given 3D scene
- implementing rotations on axis.
- doing the project enhanced my understanding of transformations and implementation of shading
- Got to understand and see how 3D images are formed and the animation to create them using rendering. 
- How to change views using keypresses, implementing different shaders
- How to generate and work with mashes & a lot of patience
- How vertices and fragments are processed separately, their extensive understanding
- how we are using transformation matrices to change world coordinates to camera coordinates
- learned a lot more about WebGL as well as concepts for lighting, shading, terrain generation, camera coordinates, ortho and perspective viewing and viewing volume etc.
- learned about concatenating transformations
- rendering 3d geometry and transforming camera coordinates in webgl
- how to generate meshes, how to make a triangular mesh, generating vertices dynamically to simulate terrain
- Rotations in world and camera coordinates"

Improvement and other feedback
-

The students had the following comments about potential improvement and other aspects of the homework.

- Conducting WebGL tutorials in lab.
- The option to choose a group instead of automatically assigning.
- Teaching perlin noise in class.
- Giving more time."
- do not include topics that haven't yet been taught in class (Shading).
- Keep the allotted time more than 2 weeks for a project whose parts can only be developed sequentially and not in parallel by 4 people (like the HWs).
- This project expects way too much in very little time especially given the fact that certain aspects (shading) of the project were only very recently (last week) covered in class."
- By explaining project topics before assigning project
- By giving more clear instructions
- Have more clarity on the movement of the "plane" after pitch, yaw, and roll.
- maybe incorporating a plane model through an obj file and being able to see it move from another camera, side view, would also have been interesting.
- I don't think it lacks anything in its current state.
- I was also interested in seeing how we can create an effect of water movement changing the reflection it gives off"
- I would have enjoyed this a lot more if we had more creative freedom.
- I'm quite sad to say that this project took all the fun away from learning CG in the form of WebGL. It was 90% chaos and 10% actual learning.
- More reference links and explanation for how to go about doing things.
- the course could introduce some lab sessions on WebGL.
- The following link is a good resource for labs: https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/315/WebGL/Lab1/
- a short video should be released along with the project that explains the rubrics. This will ensure clarity and that everyone has the same information. Hearing multiple things can confuse you and waste important time.
- Some of the requirements felt way out of scope of what was taught in class, such as Phong shading.
- The project was interesting, challenging and a lot of fun!
- it would be a relief if there would be a late policy because sometimes unexpected issues do arise.
- It was well explained and the instructions were clear. So, in my opinion there is no room for improvement.
- >_< i died
- I am sorry for being a disappointment
- hello world
