# Flight-Simulator-WEBGL
We have created a basic flight simulator using only WEB-GL. We have created this by generating a terrain and manipulating the model view matrix in order to create the illusion of moving flight. 

# Controls:
Use WASD to move the camera.

# Requirements:
Just run simulator.html.
